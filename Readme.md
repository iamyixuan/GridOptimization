# Grid Optimization

This is an attempt on GO competition dataset using Machine Learning.
The objective of GO competition is to accelerate the development of transformational and disruptive methods for solving power system optimization problems, including Preventative Security Constrained AC Optimal Power, where a generation dispatch at the least cost to meet system load in the base case is needed. This project is an attempt to tackle this problem using machine learning regression algorithms. The initial trial dataset used here is IEEE 14-Bus (100 scenarios).
